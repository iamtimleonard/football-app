# CURRENTLY BROKEN DUE TO CHANGES IN API
# College Football Scores Search App

This app is designed using the API found at https://api.collegefootballdata.com/. Search Division I colleges and specify a season to retrieve the season results. Click through to see the game stats and matchup history between the two schools.
"Week" represents the FBS week, the date is given in the game breakdown.

## Deployment

There are no data for scores for each quarter before 2001 - the table in the game breakdown will just read "no data" and give totals. Schools with smaller football programs might not be represented in the database, either.

## Built With

* Axios (https://github.com/axios/axios)
* Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com)
* Swagger UI API (https://api.collegefootballdata.com/)
